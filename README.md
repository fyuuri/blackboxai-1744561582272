# Mathematical Abacus

## Project Overview
Mathematical Abacus is a web-based tool designed to simulate a traditional abacus for educational purposes. It allows users to interact with a virtual abacus, add and clear beads, and provides drag-and-drop functionality for enhanced usability. This project aims to help students visualize and understand numerical concepts and basic arithmetic using a classic method of counting.

## Installation
To run the Mathematical Abacus application locally, follow these instructions:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mathematical-abacus
   ```

2. **Open the index.html file**
   You can simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser without any additional setup, as this project does not require any server-side technology.

## Usage
1. **Select a spoke** by clicking on one of the vertical bars.
2. **Add beads**: Click on the "Add Circle to Spoke" button to add a bead to the selected spoke. You can add a maximum of 15 beads to each spoke.
3. **Clear a spoke**: Click on the "Clear Spoke" button to remove all beads from the selected spoke.
4. **Drag and drop beads**: Move beads up and down within the selected spoke by dragging them with your mouse.

## Features
- Interactive virtual abacus with customizable beads
- Drag-and-drop functionality for moving beads vertically
- Clear beads from spokes easily
- Educational tool for understanding number placement and manipulation

## Dependencies
This project does not use any external libraries or frameworks, making it lightweight and easy to maintain. It solely relies on vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
